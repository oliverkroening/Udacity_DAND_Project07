    "# Udacity Data Analyst Project 07: Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrangling Data is an importing issue within the iterative circle of data analysis since real-world data rarely comes clean. Additionally multiple sources are needed to gather alle the data required for a complete analysis or visualization of a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context and Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this document is to show the data wrangling of WeRateDogs Twitter data to prepare the data content for further analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for interesting analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fulfill the task of this project, only original ratings are considered to wrangle this dataset. Thus, no retweets are gathered.\n",
    "For assessing and cleaning the dataset, at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues have to be tackled. Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the WeRateDogs Twitter archive containing basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets is given as a CSV-file by Udacity. This data is downloaded programmatically, but not all data are correct and well formatted. A assessment and cleaning is needed to prepare this data for further work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Twitter archives data can be supplemented by gathering data from the website using Twitter's API. Here, the tweet IDs within the Twitter archive can be used to access this data of all 5000+ tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify the dogs within the tweets, an image prediction using a neural network can be applied. An image prediction data file (TSV-file) has to be programmatically accessed."
